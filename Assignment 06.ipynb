    "The class can be defined as a collection of objects. It is a logical entity that has some specific attributes and methods. For example: if you have an employee class then it should contain an attribute and method, i.e. an email id, name, age, salary, etc.\n",

    "The object is an entity that has state and behavior. It may be any real-world object like the mouse, keyboard, chair, table, pen, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Attribute:\n",
    "Class attributes are different from instance attributes. An attribute whose value is the same for all instances of a class is called a class attribute. The value of class attribute is shared by all objects. Class attributes are defined at class level rather than inside the constructor method __init__(). Unlike instance attributes, class attributes are accessed using the name of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Behavior:\n",
    "You can define as many methods as you want in a class using the def keyword. Each method must have the first parameter, generally named as self which refers to the calling instance."
